# 🎬 Shortest Path to Tom Cruise (Angular)

## 📌 Project Overview

This Angular project finds the **shortest path** between a given actor and **Tom Cruise** based on movie appearances. The path alternates between actors and movies, ensuring an **optimal connection** using **Graph Data Structure** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm**.

### **✨ Features**

✅ Load dataset of movies and their cast from JSON (simulating an API).
✅ Build a **Graph (Adjacency List)** where actors and movies are connected.
✅ Use **BFS Algorithm** to find the **shortest path** between an actor and Tom Cruise.
✅ User-friendly **Angular UI** with:

- A **dropdown** to select an actor.
- A **button** to compute and display the path.
  ✅ Optimized for performance (**O(V + E)** complexity).
